# StreamExecutor

I start this project since I need a standalone StreamExecutor runtime library (https://github.com/henline/streamexecutordoc). However, at the time of writing, StreamExecutor has not been open-sourced (or I haven't found it) so I decide to make my own library. The code will be mostly ported form tensorflow/stream_executor but I want to make it a standalone library for my own purpose.
